Why
-------------

This repository is for saving 
1. The stuff I learnt while going through this (https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/) course

2. My solutions to leetcode and hackerrank problems

I hope someone finds the stuff here useful sometime in the future :-)

How to run
--------------
Install nodejs at https://nodejs.org/ and run node {fileName} to run whatever file

I added comments in some of the more complex files to help walkthrough the code.

If you have an issue with any of the code you can contact me @Nifade_ on twitter
